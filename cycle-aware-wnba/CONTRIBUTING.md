# Q4Trackr Contribution Guidelines

Thank you for considering a contribution! Q4Trackr is civic-minded, modular, and welcomes playful satire, but always respects athlete dignity.

## Ethical Contribution Principles

- All modeling must center athlete consent, privacy, and dignity.
- Satirical UX overlays (CrampCast™, MoodSwingMeter™) are welcome but must never trivialize health or performance.
- Code must be reproducible, transparent, and open for civic scrutiny.

## How to Contribute

1. Fork the repo and create a new branch.
2. Add your modular code, satirical UX, or reporting enhancement.
3. Include documentation and explainability commentary.
4. Submit a pull request, referencing relevant tags.

## Satirical UX Tone

- Satire should provoke critical thought, not mock or undermine real issues.
- All overlays must be toggleable (see dashboard/app.R).
- For examples, see docs/UX_mockups/.

## Reporting & Testing

- Include tests in `tests/test_model.R`.
- Document any new data columns in `data/schema.md`.
