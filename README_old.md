## 🛡️ **Ethical Framing**
> **Civic-Grade Principles for Satirical Sports Analytics**
> 
> 🛡️ **Respect:** All data is fictional, satirical, and never used for real medical inference.  
> 🛡️ **Privacy:** No real athlete or menstrual data is tracked. All models are parody.  
> 🛡️ **Transparency:** Satirical overlays are clearly labeled. Civic humor, not harm.  
> 🛡️ **Accountability:** Built for laughter and critical thinking, not real-world decisions.
