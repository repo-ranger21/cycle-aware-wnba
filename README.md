# 🩸 **Cycle-Aware WNBA Intelligence Platform**
_Comprehensive Data Ingestion for Ethical, Privacy-First Sports Analytics_

> **"Empowering cycle-aware insights through responsible data intelligence."**

## 🌟 **Project Overview**

The Cycle-Aware WNBA Intelligence Platform is a sophisticated data ingestion and analysis system designed to explore the relationship between menstrual cycles and athletic performance in a responsible, ethical manner. Our platform integrates multiple data sources to provide comprehensive insights while maintaining the highest standards of privacy, consent, and athlete dignity.

### **Core Mission**
- **Research-Driven**: Scientific exploration of cycle-performance correlations
- **Privacy-First**: All data is anonymized and consent-verified
- **Ethical Framework**: Transparent, non-exploitative, and athlete-centered
- **Civic Reporting**: Open science approach with clear methodology
- **Educational Purpose**: Advancing understanding of women's health in sports

## 🔧 **Intelligence Feeds Architecture**

Our platform integrates five primary data sources through a standardized, ethical ingestion framework:

### **1. Clue Cycle Data (via Terra API)**
- **Purpose**: Anonymized menstrual cycle tracking data
- **Data Types**: Flow patterns, ovulation predictions, symptom tracking
- **Privacy Level**: Anonymized, consent-verified
- **Retention**: 90 days maximum

### **2. Wearable Biometric Data (OAuth Integration)**
- **Purpose**: Physiological monitoring from consumer wearables
- **Supported Devices**: Fitbit, Garmin, Oura Ring, Apple HealthKit
- **Data Types**: Heart rate, sleep quality, body temperature, activity levels
- **Privacy Level**: Anonymized, encrypted at rest
- **Retention**: 30 days maximum (sensitive biometric data)

### **3. WNBA Performance Data (SportsData.io)**
- **Purpose**: Comprehensive game statistics and performance metrics
- **Data Types**: Game logs, season stats, injury reports, contextual data
- **Privacy Level**: Public performance data only
- **Coverage**: Complete WNBA seasons, team schedules, player statistics

### **4. Environmental Context (OpenWeatherMap)**
- **Purpose**: Weather and environmental factors that may influence performance
- **Data Types**: Temperature, humidity, air quality, seasonal patterns
- **Coverage**: All WNBA team cities and game locations
- **Use Case**: Understanding environmental impacts on cycle symptoms

### **5. Social Sentiment Analysis (Twitter NLP)**
- **Purpose**: Public perception and potential stress indicators
- **Data Types**: Player mentions, game reactions, media coverage sentiment
- **Privacy Level**: Public social media content only
- **Analysis**: Rule-based and external NLP service options

## 🛡️ **Ethical Framework**

### **Privacy-First Principles**
- 🔒 **Consent Verification**: All data sources require explicit athlete consent
- 🎭 **Anonymization**: No personal identifiers stored or processed
- 📝 **Audit Trail**: Complete logging of all data access and processing
- ⏰ **Limited Retention**: Shortest possible data retention periods
- 🚫 **No Medical Decisions**: Results never used for selection or medical diagnosis

### **Responsible AI & Analytics**
- 🧠 **Explainable Models**: All predictions include feature importance and reasoning
- 📊 **Transparency**: Open methodology and bias documentation
- ⚖️ **Fairness**: Regular bias testing and correction
- 🎯 **Purpose Limitation**: Data used only for stated research purposes
- 📚 **Educational Focus**: Results contribute to scientific understanding

### **Athlete-Centered Design**
- 👥 **Dignity First**: Respectful representation of women's health
- 💬 **Community Input**: Regular feedback from athletes and advocates
- 🎓 **Educational Value**: Focus on awareness and understanding
- 🚪 **Right to Withdraw**: Easy opt-out mechanisms for all participants

print(f"Fetched {len(cycle_data)} cycle records")
print(f"Fetched {len(performance_data)} performance records")
```

1. **Terra API** (Clue data): [https://tryterra.co/](https://tryterra.co/)
2. **SportsData.io** (WNBA stats): [https://sportsdata.io/](https://sportsdata.io/)
3. **OpenWeatherMap** (Weather): [https://openweathermap.org/api](https://openweathermap.org/api)
4. **Twitter API v2** (Sentiment): [https://developer.twitter.com/](https://developer.twitter.com/)

## 📊 **Usage Examples**

### **Multi-Source Data Integration**

```python
import pandas as pd
from datetime import datetime, timedelta
from intelligence_feeds import *

# Initialize all data sources
sources = {
    'cycle': ClueDataSource(api_key=os.getenv('TERRA_API_KEY')),
    'performance': WNBADataSource(api_key=os.getenv('SPORTSDATA_API_KEY')),
    'weather': WeatherDataSource(api_key=os.getenv('OPENWEATHER_API_KEY')),
    'sentiment': SentimentDataSource({
        'bearer_token': os.getenv('TWITTER_BEARER_TOKEN')
    })
}

# Define analysis parameters
players = ['Breanna Stewart', 'A\'ja Wilson', 'Diana Taurasi']
date_range = (datetime(2024, 6, 1), datetime(2024, 8, 15))

# Collect data from all sources
all_data = {}
for source_name, source in sources.items():
    try:
        data = source.fetch_data(players, date_range)
        all_data[source_name] = data
        print(f"✅ {source_name}: {len(data)} records")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"❌ {source_name}: {str(e)}")

# Merge and analyze
if all_data:
    # Custom analysis logic here
    print(f"🎯 Ready for cycle-aware analysis with {sum(len(d) for d in all_data.values())} total records")
```

### **Individual Source Analysis**

```python
# Detailed cycle pattern analysis
clue_source = ClueDataSource(api_key="your_api_key")
cycle_data = clue_source.fetch_data(
    player_ids=['anonymized_player_1'], 
    date_range=(datetime(2024, 7, 1), datetime(2024, 8, 1)),
    data_types=['menstruation', 'fertility']
)

# Analyze cycle patterns
if not cycle_data.empty:
    avg_cycle_length = cycle_data['cycle_length'].mean()
    symptom_severity = cycle_data['symptoms_cramps'].mean()
    print(f"Average cycle length: {avg_cycle_length:.1f} days")
    print(f"Average cramp severity: {symptom_severity:.1f}/4")
```
